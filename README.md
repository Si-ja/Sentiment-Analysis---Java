# Sentiment Analysis with Java

I wanted to work on a simple instance of code that would allow to classify sentiment of sentences, using Java as a tool for this. As well, I wanted to look into unit testing for code development and put it together with creating of a small GUI as a front-end for the users to interact with. All done in IntelliJ (as I actually do not have so much experience with it and most of my previous work was done in Eclipse). As a result, everything boiled down to this project.

A very simple GUI interface has been designed that can predict the sentiment of sentences the user inserts (yes, multiple are possible). For that `edu.stanford.nlp` module is used.
